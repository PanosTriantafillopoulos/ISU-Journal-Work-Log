# ISU-Journal-Work-Log
This repository will be a work log journal for my ISU which will include my research, sources, and outline of my ISU as I continue to work on it.

a. Title for your project is about

ANS: The title of my project will be __Eternal Curse__.

b. A sentence on the purpose of the project

ANS: The purpose of the project will be to concentrate my knowledge of coding techniques I learned and reviewed in grade 12 while incorporating my new knowledge of Object Oriented Programing in order to create a game that demonstrates and showcases my knowledge of coding thus far in a visual and interactive way.

c. Goal: What do you want to have finished by the middle of June?

ANS: By the middle of June I want to have successfully created an endless survival type game (similar to Vampire Survivors) with at least three different levels/landscapes, a xp and level up system, increasing enemy difficulty, main menus, and level ups. In the best casenario I will have created a game in which no play-through looks identical to the last which will propell my project forward in terms of complexity and the degree to which it is neuanced.


d. Technology used: What are you using to make the project?

ANS: This game will utilize Pygame + python
